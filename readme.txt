If you want to hide affiliate links from your users and avoid Page Rank leakage then Simple Link Cloaker can help you. Using its simple interface you can convert a long and ugly link into one that looks like http://yourdomain.com/visit/link-slug/.

**Fast & Simple:** It has a really easy-to-use and fast interface using which you can cloak dozens of links in a matter of minutes.

**Redirection Types:** While cloaking an affiliate link it allows you to choose from two redirection types. You can either select 301 permanent redirection or 302 temporary redirection.

**Multiple Link Structures:** The links created by the plugin have this structure: http://yourdomain.com/visit/link-slug/. However instead of the word 'visit' the words 'out' and 'go' can also be used without any issues.
